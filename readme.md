# Welcome to the ekg.ninja code repository!

This was a project I did as I learned front-end programming.

I sought out to improve my skills with HTML5 and CSS3.  Before starting the project, I did not know how to create responsive websites, how to use twitter bootstrap, and how to customize Javascript components.

## What is ekg.ninja?
This is meant to be a marketing page for an Electrocardiogram course for medical students and residents.  I have created a webpage where people can sign up to find out when the course goes live.
